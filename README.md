**Problem 19.** Write a program that takes a five-digit number as input and checks if it is a palindrome (DO NOT use a number as a string, that is, you CANNOT do comparisons like number[0] == number[4]. Use the % and / operators).
</br>14212 -> no
</br>12821 -> yes
</br>23432 -> yes

**Problem 21.** Write a program that takes the coordinates of two points as input and finds the distance between them in 3D space.
</br>A(3,6,8); B(2,1,-7), -> 15.84
</br>A(7,-5, 0); B(1,-1,9) -> 11.53

**Problem 23.** Write a program that takes a number (N) as input and produces a table of cubes of numbers from 1 to N.
</br>3 -> 1, 8, 27
</br>5 -> 1, 8, 27, 64, 125
